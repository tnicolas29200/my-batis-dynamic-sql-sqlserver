# my-batis-dynamic-sql-sqlserver
SQLServer extension of MyBatis DynamicSQL library : https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql

The goal of this library is to extend the MyBatis DynamicSQL library with some specific implementation for SQLServer : the author of original library doesn't want to integrate some proprietary functions, so i develop this one :)
