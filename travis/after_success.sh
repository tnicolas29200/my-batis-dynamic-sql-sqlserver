# We build for several JDKs on Travis.
# Some actions, like analyzing the code (Coveralls) and uploading
# artifacts on a Maven repository, should only be made for one version.
 
# If the version is 1.8, then perform the following actions.
# 1. Notify Coveralls.
#    a. Use -q option to only display Maven errors and warnings.
# If this is a build on the master branch and not a pull request then
# 2. Upload artifacts to Sonatype.
#    a. Use -q option to only display Maven errors and warnings.
#    b. Use --settings to force the usage of our "settings.xml" file.
